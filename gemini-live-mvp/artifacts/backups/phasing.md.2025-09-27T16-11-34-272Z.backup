## Phase 1: Core Breathing Exercise Development

In this initial phase, we'll focus on building the fundamental breathing exercises. This involves designing the guided audio or visual cues for different breathing techniques, ensuring they're clear and easy to follow. We'll also establish the basic structure for how these exercises will be presented to the user. When this phase is done, you'll be able to access and complete a guided breathing exercise.

## Phase 2: Progress Tracking Integration

Next, we'll integrate the progress tracking system. This phase will involve creating the backend logic to record user activity, such as completed sessions and duration. We'll also design the user interface elements that display this progress in an intuitive and encouraging way. When this phase is done, you'll be able to perform breathing exercises and see your meditation activity being tracked.

## Phase 3: User Interface Refinement and Testing

Finally, we'll refine the overall user interface and conduct thorough testing of the entire meditation project. This includes polishing the visual design, ensuring smooth navigation, and making any necessary adjustments based on user feedback. We'll also test the functionality of both the breathing exercises and the progress tracking to ensure a seamless experience. When this phase is done, you'll have a fully functional and polished meditation project with integrated breathing exercises and progress tracking.
