## Phase 1: Core User and Task Management
We'll begin by setting up the foundational elements of your to-do app. This includes implementing robust user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles. Concurrently, we'll develop the core task management functionalities, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete their individual to-do items. We'll also ensure the app works offline, providing a seamless experience even without an internet connection. When this phase is done, you'll be able to create an account, manage your personal to-do list, and use the app offline.

## Phase 2: Collaboration and Real-time Updates
With the core in place, we'll shift our focus to making your to-do app collaborative and interactive. This phase involves integrating real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on shared to-do lists and see updates instantly. We'll also implement a robust notification system to alert users about changes, assignments, or approaching deadlines. This will likely involve setting up WebSockets for real-time communication and a backend service to manage notification delivery. When this phase is done, you'll be able to share to-do lists with others, collaborate in real-time, and receive important notifications.

## Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience and Performance
In this final phase, we'll concentrate on refining the user experience and optimizing the app's performance. This includes implementing a dark mode option for visual comfort and accessibility. We'll also perform thorough testing and debugging to ensure the application is stable, fast, and provides a smooth user experience across different devices. This phase will also involve optimizing data synchronization for offline capabilities and ensuring efficient handling of real-time updates. When this phase is done, you'll have a polished, high-performing to-do application with a dark mode and a superior user experience.
