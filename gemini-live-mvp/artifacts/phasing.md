## Phase 1: Core Dog Interaction and Profile System
We'll begin by developing the fundamental mechanics for dog interactions, focusing on accurately detecting licks for "swiping" and barks for "super liking." This involves exploring sensor integration or image recognition techniques to interpret these canine actions. Concurrently, we'll build the dog profile creation system, allowing owners to set up profiles with photos and basic information about their pets. When this phase is done, you'll be able to create a dog profile and have your dog register "likes" and "super likes" through their natural behaviors.

## Phase 2: Matchmaking Algorithm and User Interface
Next, we'll implement the matchmaking algorithm that intelligently suggests potential dog companions based on various factors like proximity, breed, and owner preferences. We'll also design and develop the user interface for both the dog (the interactive display for licking/barking) and the human owner (for managing profiles, viewing matches, and communicating). This phase will focus on creating a seamless and engaging experience for both pets and their owners. When this phase is done, you'll be able to view suggested dog profiles, and your dog will be able to interact with the interface to make match selections.

## Phase 3: Communication, Social Features, and Notifications
In this phase, we'll integrate communication features, allowing owners of matched dogs to chat and arrange playdates. We'll also add social elements like a "pack" feature where multiple dog friends can be grouped, and a notification system to alert owners about new matches, messages, or nearby dog-friendly events. This phase will enhance the community aspect of the app and keep users engaged. When this phase is done, you'll be able to communicate with other dog owners, receive notifications, and manage your dog's social circle within the app.
