# WalkCoach iOS App

## Phase 0 Complete ✅

Successfully forked VoiceAgent template with:
- ✅ Exact UI preservation (glassmorphic design, animations, four-state system)
- ✅ Updated to WalkCoach branding
- ✅ Removed WebSocket relay backend
- ✅ Removed ElevenLabs TTS
- ✅ Kept Groq STT integration
- ✅ Build succeeds

## Setup Instructions

1. **Add your GROQ API key** to `.env`:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
```

2. **Build and run**:
```bash
./run-sim.sh
```

## Current Functionality

The app currently:
1. Shows the beautiful glassmorphic UI from VoiceAgent
2. Records audio when you press and hold the button
3. Transcribes using Groq Whisper when you release
4. Displays the transcription in the text area

## Known Issues

- Without a valid GROQ_API_KEY, transcription will fail with "Transcription failed - check GROQ_API_KEY"
- The app needs Phase 1-13 implementation for full walkcoach functionality

## UI States

The four visual states work as designed:
- **Idle** (blue button) - Ready to record
- **Recording** (red pulsing) - Capturing audio
- **Transcribing** (spinner) - Processing with Groq
- **Result** (text displayed) - Shows transcription

## Next Steps

Phase 1 will begin implementing the Router and intent detection using Groq Kimi K2.
