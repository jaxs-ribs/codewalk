# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Basic Swipe Interface
So first we'll build the core swipe mechanism with React Native and the Tinder card animation library. You'll create a simple card component showing a dog's photo, name, and basic info that users can swipe left (pass) or right (like). We'll use AsyncStorage to temporarily store swipe data locally and set up the basic navigation between the main swipe screen and a simple matches list.
**Definition of Done:** Open the app, swipe right on three dogs, then check the matches screen - you should see those three dogs listed as matches that persist when you restart the app.

## Phase 2: Firebase Backend Setup
Next we'll connect everything to Firebase for real user accounts and dog profiles. You'll set up Firebase Authentication with email/password login, create a Firestore database to store dog profiles with photos, names, ages and breeds, and implement the matching logic where two users only match if they both swipe right on each other's dogs. We'll also add proper error handling for network issues and loading states.
**Definition of Done:** Create a new account, add your dog with photo and details, then have a friend create their account and swipe right on your dog - you should see their dog appear in your swipe queue and get a match notification when you swipe right back.

## Phase 3: Dog Profiles & Photos
Then we'll make the dog profiles much richer with multiple photos, detailed breed info, personality traits like "friendly with kids" or "needs lots of exercise", age and size categories. You'll add a photo upload system using Firebase Storage, create an edit profile screen where owners can update their dog's info, and implement photo verification to ensure dogs look like their pictures.
**Definition of Done:** Upload 4 photos of your dog, fill out all profile fields including personality traits, then view your profile - it should display as a complete card with smooth photo carousel and all details formatted nicely.

## Phase 4: Chat & Social Features
After that we'll add the social layer with real-time chat between matched users using Firebase's real-time database, push notifications for new matches and messages, and the ability to share dog photos in chat. You'll create a chat interface similar to WhatsApp but simpler, with typing indicators and read receipts, plus a way to report inappropriate messages.
**Definition of Done:** Match with another user, send them a message saying "Want to meet at the park?", and receive their reply within 10 seconds with a push notification appearing on your phone.

## Phase 5: Discovery & Safety
Finally we'll add location-based discovery to find dogs nearby using GPS, implement reporting and blocking features for safety, create breed-specific search filters, and add premium features like unlimited swipes or seeing who liked your dog first. You'll optimize everything for performance with proper indexing and caching, plus add analytics to track which features users love most.
**Definition of Done:** Filter dogs by "Golden Retriever" within 5 miles, successfully block a user and confirm they can't see your profile anymore, then check that the premium upgrade button appears after you've swiped 20 times.
