# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Core Matching
So first we’ll build the Tinder-for-dogs swipe flow: upload a pup pic, set age/breed/vax status, then swipe through local dogs. We’ll harden the glass with an oleophobic coat so eager snouts don’t scratch.
**Definition of Done:** Five rescue dogs appear, user swipes right on one, match screen pops, and screen stays smudge-free after 20 nose taps.

## Phase 2: Swipe-to-Lick
Next we’ll flip the gesture: dog swipes nose across screen → treat pops, reinforcing “swipe to lick.” We’ll log each swipe as a wellness interaction and store duration/pressure for later health metrics.
**Definition of Done:** Dog swipes nose, treat sound plays within 200 ms, pressure data saved, and no false triggers from drool.

## Phase 3: Wellness Dashboard
After that we’ll pivot to wellness: aggregate swipe stats into daily energy scores, integrate HealthKit via iPhone mic to hear panting rates, and ping owners when patterns drift.
**Definition of Done:** Owner opens dashboard, sees “Energy: 87% normal,” receives push if 20% drop over 3 days.

## Phase 4: Vet Partnership
Finally we’ll monetize wellness: sell vet-verified chew-proof screen protectors, let clinics push vaccination reminders through the app, and reward matches with partner shelters for free check-ups.
**Definition of Done:** User buys protector in-app, receives barcode for free vet visit, and booking API confirms appointment within 24 hours.
