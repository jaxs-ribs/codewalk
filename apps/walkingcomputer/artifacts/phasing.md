# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Core Swipe
So first we’ll code the heart of the app: cards of gods/goddesses that you swipe left or right, plus the little floating halo overlay as you drag, all in SwiftUI.
**Definition of Done:** Swipe ten cards, match appears, halo animation plays on every drag.

## Phase 2: Placeholder
This is a placeholder.

## Phase 3: Divine Chat
After that we’ll wire a tiny chat screen so matched gods can trade short blessings; keep it to text bubbles and a single “Send” button, nothing fancy.
**Definition of Done:** Type “Hello” in chat, tap Send, message shows instantly for both users.

## Phase 4: Cloud Sync
Finally we’ll hook the whole thing to Firebase so your matches and chats survive app restarts and appear on any iOS device you sign into.
**Definition of Done:** Log in on second phone, see identical matches and chat history.
