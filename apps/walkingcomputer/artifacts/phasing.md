# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Initialize React App
Initialize a new React TypeScript project and verify it runs.
**Definition of Done:** Run `npx create-react-app dog-walker-app --template typescript`, then `npm start`, see React logo spinning at localhost:3000

## Phase 2: Clean Project Structure
Remove default boilerplate and create folder structure.
**Definition of Done:** Delete App.test.tsx, logo.svg, and App.css, create folders: components/, services/, types/, run `npm start`, see blank page with no errors

## Phase 3: Install Dependencies
Add React Router and other essential packages.
**Definition of Done:** Run `npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom`, verify package.json shows these dependencies

## Phase 4: Create Walk Form Component
Build a form component with walker name, date, time, and dogs fields.
**Definition of Done:** Open browser, see form with 4 labeled input fields and a submit button

## Phase 5: Add Form State Management
Implement React hooks to capture form data.
**Definition of Done:** Type 'Sarah' in name field, see console log output: `{walkerName: 'Sarah', date: '', time: '', dogs: ''}` when typing

## Phase 6: Build Walk List Component
Create a component to display scheduled walks in a table.
**Definition of Done:** Pass hardcoded array `[{walkerName: 'Mike', date: '2024-01-15', time: '09:00', dogs: 2}]`, see table with one row showing the data

## Phase 7: Connect Form to Display
Link form submission to add walks to the list.
**Definition of Done:** Fill form with 'Lisa, 2024-01-16, 10:00, 1', click submit, see new row appear in table below existing data
