# Project Description

We'll build a slick HTML5 Snake game that feels fresh and modern. The core is classic snake movement, but we'll spice it up with portals you can zip through to jump across the board and a slick wall-wrap dash move so you can blast through one edge and pop out the opposite side. Every action gets juicy sound effects and smooth little animations so eating apples, zipping through portals, and dashing feel satisfying. The goal is simple: keep munching apples, growing longer, and dodging your own tail while using portals and dashes to pull off clutch saves.
