# Project Description

We're building a simple iOS app that's basically Tinder for dogs, focused on setting up doggy playdates. Owners create quick profiles for their pups—just a photo, name, age, and a short personality blurb—then swipe through nearby dogs. When two owners swipe right on each other's dogs, they match and can chat to arrange a meet-up at a local park or trail. The whole flow stays lightweight: no long questionnaires, no grooming checklists, just swipe, match, and message so dogs can start playing as soon as possible.
