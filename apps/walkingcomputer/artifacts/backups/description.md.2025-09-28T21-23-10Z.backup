# Project Description

PawSwipe is Tinder for dogs on iOS. Users create profiles for their pups with photos, name, age, breed, and a short bio, then swipe through local dogs. When two owners swipe right on each other's pets, they match and can chat to set up playdates. The hook is bark-to-match: when your dog barks near the phone, the app instantly likes the current profile, making the experience fun for both human and hound. Profiles refresh daily so there are always new furry faces, and matched chats stay open until an owner chooses to unmatch. No location sharing beyond the basic proximity needed for the stack, and everything stays focused on the dogsâ€”no people pics required. The goal is simple: let dogs find friends, let owners find dog people, and maybe spark some romances along the way.
