# Project Description

So we're building a mobile app that's basically Tinder but for dogs. The idea is simple - dog owners create profiles for their pups and swipe through other dogs in their area to find playmates, breeding partners, or just new friends at the park.

Each dog profile will have photos, basic info like name age breed and size, plus personality traits and energy levels. We're thinking big here - owners can add vaccination records, training certificates, even special needs or dietary restrictions. The app will use your location to show nearby dogs, with filters for distance age size and breed preferences. When two owners both swipe right on each other's dogs, they match and can start chatting right in the app.

The matching algorithm is pretty smart. Beyond just location and basic preferences, it considers compatibility factors like energy levels, play styles, and whether dogs prefer indoor or outdoor activities. We're building a reputation system too - after meetups, owners can rate the experience so other users know which dogs are well socialized.

For safety, every profile needs verification. Owners upload photos of themselves with their dog plus vet records. We're adding report and block features, plus a premium tier that includes background checks. The app handles multiple dogs per owner, so if you've got a whole pack they each get their own profile.

We're planning some fun extras like a built in scheduler for playdates, local dog park recommendations, and even emergency features to quickly contact vets or report lost dogs. The goal is creating real connections between dogs and their humans, making it easier to find the perfect playmate for your furry best friend.
