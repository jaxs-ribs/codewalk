# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Create HTML Canvas and Game Loop
Create the HTML5 canvas element and implement the basic game loop that continuously renders at 60fps.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html in browser, see a blank canvas element filling most of the viewport, open console and verify "game loop running" prints every frame

## Phase 2: Draw Grid-Based Snake
Implement the snake as a series of connected squares on a grid system with basic rendering.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, see a static snake made of 3 green square segments positioned in the center of the canvas

## Phase 3: Add Continuous Movement
Make the snake move continuously in one direction using requestAnimationFrame for smooth motion.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, watch snake move smoothly to the right, when it reaches right edge it wraps around to left side

## Phase 4: Keyboard Direction Controls
Add keyboard input to change the snake's direction of movement.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, use arrow keys to change snake direction while it's moving, snake responds immediately without reversing into itself

## Phase 5: Add Food and Growth
Spawn food items randomly on the grid and make the snake grow when eating food.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, see red food square appear on grid, move snake to touch food, observe snake grow by one segment and new food spawn elsewhere

## Phase 6: Game Over Conditions
Implement collision detection for snake hitting walls or itself.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, steer snake into wall edge - game stops and displays "Game Over" message, restart and steer snake into its own body - game stops

## Phase 7: Add Score Display
Track and display the player's score based on food eaten.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, eat one food item - see score display "Score: 1" on screen, eat three more food items - see score display "Score: 4"

## Phase 8: Create Portal Pairs
Add two portals (blue and orange) that teleport the snake between fixed positions.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, see blue circle at position A and orange circle at position B, move snake into blue portal - snake instantly appears at orange portal position while maintaining direction

## Phase 9: Implement Wall Dash
Add spacebar-triggered dash that lets the snake pass through walls briefly.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, position snake facing wall, press spacebar - see snake pass through wall and emerge on opposite side with brief invincibility effect

## Phase 10: Add Eating Sound
Implement a crunch sound effect when the snake eats food.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, eat food item - hear distinct crunch sound through speakers, eat multiple food items rapidly - sounds play cleanly without clipping

## Phase 11: Add Portal Teleport Sound
Add a whoosh sound effect when using portals.
**Definition of Done:** Open index.html, move snake through portal - hear whoosh sound effect, use portals multiple times - sounds play smoothly without overlap issues
