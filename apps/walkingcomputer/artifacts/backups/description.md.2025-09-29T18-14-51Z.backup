# Project Description

We're building a fun, swipe-based iOS app that works just like Tinder but for dogs. Think of it as a social playground where dog owners create profiles for their furry friends - they'll upload photos, add basic info like name, age, breed, and a short bio. The main screen shows one dog profile at a time, and you swipe right if you think they're adorable or left to pass. When two owners both swipe right on each other's dogs, it's a match and they can start chatting to set up playdates or just share cute dog pics. We'll keep it super simple to start - just the core swiping, matching, and messaging features. No complex algorithms or premium features for now, just a clean, playful way for dog lovers to connect their pets with new friends in the neighborhood.
