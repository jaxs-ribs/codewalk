# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Basic Swipe Interface
So first we'll build the core swipe mechanic that makes this app fun. We'll create a card-based interface where dog profiles appear as cards you can swipe left to pass or right to like. We'll use SwiftUI's drag gestures to make the cards feel natural as you swipe, adding that satisfying spring animation when cards snap into place. The app will start with a few hardcoded dog profiles including photos, names, ages and breeds. We'll build the main view controller that manages the card stack and handles the swipe gestures, plus we'll add those cute little "LIKE" and "NOPE" stamps that appear as you swipe. When this phase is done, you'll be able to open the app and swipe through three different dog cards with smooth animations and see the stamps appear based on swipe direction.

## Phase 2: Match Logic & Profiles
Next we'll make the app actually remember your choices and create matches when two people both like each other's dogs. We'll set up Core Data to store all the dog profiles locally on the device, including their photos, details, and whether you've liked or passed on them. We'll create a simple algorithm that checks if dog A's owner likes dog B, and if dog B's owner also likes dog A, then boom - it's a match! The matched dogs will appear in a new matches screen where you can see all your successful connections. We'll also make it so you can tap on any dog card to see their full profile with bigger photos and more details about their personality, energy level, and what kind of playdates they're looking for. Once complete, you can test by liking a dog, having a friend like yours back on their device, and seeing the match notification pop up with both dogs appearing in your matches list.

## Phase 3: Photo Upload & Editing
After that we'll let users add their own dogs to the app instead of just using pre-made profiles. We'll build a photo picker that accesses the camera roll, plus let users take fresh photos right in the app. Since pet photos often need tweaking, we'll add basic editing tools - crop, brightness, and a "pet eye" fix for that weird green glow. We'll create a simple dog creation flow with fields for name, age, breed, size, energy level, and a short bio about what makes them special. The owner can set their contact preferences too - whether they want to share their phone number, email, or just chat in-app first. We'll store everything in Core Data and make the profile creation feel quick and fun, not like filling out tax forms. When finished, you'll be able to tap the plus button, add three photos of your dog, fill in their details, and see them appear as a new swipeable card in the main stack.

## Phase 4: Messaging Between Owners
Then we'll add the real social feature - letting matched owners chat about setting up playdates. We'll build a simple messaging interface that looks like the regular iOS Messages app, with conversation threads for each match. Each message will show which dog it's about with little profile pictures, and we'll include quick reply suggestions like "Want to meet at the park?" or "Does your dog like fetch?" We'll use CloudKit to sync messages between devices so both owners see the same conversation in real-time. We'll also add push notifications so you know when someone messages you about your dog, with cute custom notification sounds. Once this phase wraps up, you can open a match, type "My dog loves the dog park at 3pm, want to meet there tomorrow?" and your friend will get a notification they can tap to reply instantly.

## Phase 5: Discovery & Filters
Finally we'll make it easier to find the perfect playdate matches nearby. We'll add location services to show dogs in your area, with a simple map view that drops pins where other dogs are looking for friends. You'll be able to filter by dog size, energy level, and age range - maybe you want a gentle senior dog for your puppy to learn from, or another high-energy pup for marathon fetch sessions. We'll add a "daily picks" feature that uses basic preferences to surface 5 great matches each day. We'll also include a simple blocking system so if someone's not a good fit, you won't see them again. When this final phase is done, you can open the map, see dog profiles within 5 miles, filter for medium-sized young dogs, and get a fresh batch of perfect playdate candidates every morning.
