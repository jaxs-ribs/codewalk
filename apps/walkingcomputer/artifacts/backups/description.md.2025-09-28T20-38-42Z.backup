# Project Description

So we're building a dating app that's basically Tinder but for book lovers. The core idea is simple - instead of swiping on people's photos, you're swiping on their bookshelves. When you open the app, you'll see photos of people's actual bookshelves, all nicely lit and organized. You swipe right if you like their taste in books, left if you don't. When two people both swipe right on each other's shelves, it's a match and you can start chatting.

Now here's where it gets interesting. Each bookshelf photo needs to show the books clearly, so we're thinking good lighting and multiple angles. You can upload up to five photos of your shelf from different angles so people can really browse your collection. The app will let you tag specific books in your photos, adding titles and authors so others know what they're looking at. You can also add little notes about why you love certain books or what they mean to you.

We're including filters so you can search by genres you love. Want someone who reads sci fi and fantasy? Just filter for that. Prefer literary fiction and memoirs? You can search specifically for those shelves. The app will also let you filter by how recently someone read a book - like you can set it to only show people who've finished a book in the last month if you want someone who reads regularly.

For profiles, beyond just the bookshelf photos, you'll answer a few quick questions about your reading habits. Things like how many books you read last year, your favorite genre, and what you're currently reading. But the bookshelf is really the star here - it's your main profile picture basically.

The chat feature will have some book specific icebreakers. So instead of just saying hey, you can send things like "I loved The Night Circus too! What did you think of the ending?" or "I noticed you have a lot of Murakami - which should I start with?" We're also thinking of adding a feature where you can recommend books directly to your matches and even create shared reading lists.

For the technical side, we're starting with iOS first since that's what most of our friends use. We'll need a good camera interface for taking shelf photos, image recognition to help identify books in photos, and a solid swipe mechanism that feels natural. The backend needs to handle image uploads and matching algorithms based on book genres and reading preferences.

Basically we're creating this because we've all had that experience where you go to someone's house for the first time and immediately check out their bookshelf. It tells you so much about them - their interests, their personality, how they think. This just digitizes that experience and lets you browse thousands of potential matches based on something that actually matters for compatibility.
