# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Core Swipe Interface
So first we'll build the heart of the app - a simple swipe interface where you can flick through dog cards left or right. We'll use SwiftUI's drag gestures to create that satisfying card-fling effect, with each card showing a big dog photo, name, age, and a short bio. The cards will stack up and we'll track swipes in a basic array, nothing fancy yet. When this phase is done, you'll be able to open the app and swipe through five sample dog cards, watching them fly off screen left or right with smooth animations.

## Phase 2: Basic Matching System
Then we'll add the magic moment - when two dogs both swipe right on each other, they'll match and get added to a matches list. We'll create a simple data model with Dog structs containing their preferences, and when your swipe aligns with their preference, boom - it's a match. We'll show a little "It's a match!" popup with two dog emojis celebrating, and add the matched pup to a new view you can access from the top. Once complete, you can test by swiping right on the third dog card and seeing the match popup appear with both dogs smiling at you.

## Phase 3: Photo Upload & Profiles
Next we'll let you create your own dog's profile by adding photos from your camera roll and filling in their details. We'll integrate UIImagePickerController for photo selection, store everything in UserDefaults for now (we'll get fancier later), and create a profile tab where you can edit your pup's info and see their stats like how many matches they've made. We'll add some basic validation so every profile needs at least one photo and a name. When you finish this phase, you'll be able to tap the profile tab, add three photos of your dog, set their age and bio, and see their profile card appear in the swipe stack.

## Phase 4: Simple Chat & Meetup
After that we'll add a basic chat feature so matched dogs' owners can coordinate playdates. Nothing complex - just a simple text interface that stores messages locally, with a big "Suggest Meetup" button that grabs the current location and suggests nearby dog parks. We'll use a shared UserDefaults approach for messages between matches, keeping it super lightweight. You'll get push notifications when someone messages you, but we'll fake those for now with local notifications. When this phase wraps up, you'll be able to open a match, type "Want to meet at the park?", hit suggest meetup, and get a map pin for the closest dog park with a simple "Meet here?" message ready to send.
