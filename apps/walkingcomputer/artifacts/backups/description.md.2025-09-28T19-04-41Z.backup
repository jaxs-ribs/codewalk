# Project Description

We're building a dog dating app for iOS that's basically Tinder but for dogs. So picture this, you're walking your dog and you want to find playmates or maybe even a breeding partner, and instead of awkward conversations at the park, you just swipe through profiles of nearby dogs.

Each dog gets their own profile with photos, basic info like breed, age, size, and temperament. Pet owners can upload multiple pictures showing off their dog's personality, maybe one at the beach, another playing fetch, something that really captures who they are. We'll have a simple card interface where you swipe right if your dog likes what they see, left to pass. When two dogs both swipe right on each other, it's a match and their humans can start chatting.

The app uses location to show you dogs in your area, starting with maybe a five mile radius but you can adjust that in settings. We're thinking small, medium, large breed filters so you can match with similar sized dogs if you want. There's also a toggle for purebred versus mixed breeds, and you can filter by age range since puppies have way different energy than senior dogs.

For the matching algorithm, we're keeping it simple at first. It's mostly based on location and size compatibility, but we're tracking how people swipe so we can suggest better matches over time. If someone's constantly swiping right on golden retrievers, we'll show them more goldens nearby.

The chat feature is pretty straightforward text messaging, but we're adding quick buttons for common stuff like "want to meet at the dog park?" or "does your dog like tennis balls?" to break the ice. You can also send voice messages since typing while walking dogs is annoying.

We're building this native for iOS first, using SwiftUI for the interface since it's clean and fast. The backend will be Firebase to start since it's easy and handles real time chat. Each user needs an Apple ID to sign in, no separate passwords, and we're using iCloud to backup their dog's photos and match history.

The profile setup has to be super quick, like under two minutes. You take a photo or pick from your library, add your dog's name, birthday, breed, and a short bio. We're auto suggesting breeds as you type and calculating age from the birthday. Owners can add vaccination records too, but that's optional and private until they choose to share with a match.

We're adding a simple calendar feature where you can suggest meetup times, and it shows both owners' availability. Nothing fancy, just blocks of time that syncs with iPhone's built in calendar. There's also a flag button for inappropriate profiles, and we manually review anything that gets flagged.

The whole app is free to start, no ads at launch, but we're planning premium features later like unlimited swipes, seeing who liked your dog, or advanced filters for specific breeds or training levels. Right now we're focused on making the core experience smooth and fun, something people will actually use when they're bored on the couch thinking their dog needs more friends.
