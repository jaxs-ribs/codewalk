# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Core VM Architecture
So first we'll build the pure Haskell VM foundation with a Map-based state monad that tracks memory, registers, and program counters. We'll create the basic instruction set (load, store, add, jump) and implement a simple execution loop that produces an explicit trace of every state change. When this phase is done, you'll be able to run a simple program like "load 5 into register 1, add 3, store to memory" and see the complete step-by-step execution trace printed out.

## Phase 2: Rust FFI Bridge
Then we'll set up the Haskell-Rust FFI bridge using inline-rust to connect with arkworks zkSNARK crates. We'll expose the core proof system functions (setup, prove, verify) through a clean C-compatible interface, wrapping the complex Rust types in simple structs that Haskell can understand. Once complete, you can test by generating proving/verifying keys from Haskell and confirming the FFI calls return successfully without memory leaks.

## Phase 3: Constraint Compilation
Next we'll write the compiler that transforms each VM instruction into rank-1 constraint system (R1CS) form. For every opcode, we'll generate the corresponding arithmetic constraints that represent the state transition, building a constraint matrix that grows with each instruction executed. When this finishes, you'll be able to compile a 3-instruction program and inspect the constraint matrix to verify it correctly represents your VM's logic.

## Phase 4: Proof Integration
After that we'll wire up the proving system so the VM generates zkSNARK proofs of correct execution. We'll modify the VM to output witnesses during execution, feed these to the Rust prover through our FFI bridge, and return compact proofs that verify without revealing the actual computation. At completion, you'll be able to run a program, get back a ~1KB proof, and verify it knows the right answer without seeing the intermediate steps.

## Phase 5: Zero-Knowledge Features
Finally we'll add the zero-knowledge magic - selective disclosure of VM state, private inputs that stay hidden, and the ability to prove you ran specific code without revealing the inputs. We'll implement commitment schemes for private data and range proofs for numeric operations, giving you a fully functional zkVM. When we're done, you'll be able to prove you computed fibonacci(100) correctly without showing the actual sequence or revealing your secret starting values.
