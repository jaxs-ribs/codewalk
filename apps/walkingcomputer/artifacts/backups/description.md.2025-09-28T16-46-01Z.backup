# Project Description

We're building a zero-knowledge virtual machine in Haskell. Basically, it's a VM that can prove computations happened correctly without revealing what was actually computed. The way we're doing this is by combining Haskell's pure functional strengths with Rust's battle-tested zkSNARK libraries.

So here's how it works. We'll keep all our VM logic pure in Haskell - that's where we'll handle the virtual machine state, instruction execution, and memory management. But when we need to generate or verify zero-knowledge proofs, we'll call out to Rust through an FFI bridge using inline-rust or Haskell-Rust FFI bindings. The Rust side will use the arkworks family of crates for all the heavy cryptographic lifting.

Now, the VM itself will be structured as a state monad using Maps to represent memory and state. Each instruction gets compiled down to a rank-1 constraint system - think of these as the mathematical equations that prove our computation is valid. We're exposing the necessary zcash primitives and ff-ffi functions through our FFI layer so Haskell can talk to them.

The beautiful part is that users can run computations on this VM and get back a cryptographic proof. They can then share this proof with anyone to convince them the computation ran correctly, all without revealing any details about the actual inputs or intermediate steps. It's like being able to prove you solved a puzzle without showing anyone your solution method.

This is useful for privacy-preserving applications, verifiable computation in blockchain systems, or anywhere you need to prove something happened correctly while keeping the details secret. We're basically creating a way to have trustless verification of arbitrary computations with strong privacy guarantees.
