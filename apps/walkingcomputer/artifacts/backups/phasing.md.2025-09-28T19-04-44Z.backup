# Project Phasing

## Phase 1: Basic Setup
So first we'll get the bones of the app running with a simple Express server and MongoDB to store our dog profiles. We'll create the basic dog model with name, age, breed, and a photo field, then build out the core API routes to create and fetch profiles. The frontend will be super minimal - just a couple HTML pages to test the API works, but we'll include file upload so you can actually post dog photos. We'll also set up basic authentication with JWT so users can create accounts and log in.

**Definition of Done:** Run `npm start` and visit localhost:3000/api/dogs to see an empty JSON array, then POST a new dog profile through the form and see it appear in the response when you refresh.

## Phase 2: Swipe Interface
Then we'll build the actual swipe mechanic - a React component that fetches random dog profiles from the backend and lets you swipe left or right. We'll store swipe data in MongoDB with who swiped whom and whether it was a like or pass. The UI will be super clean with smooth transitions using CSS transforms, and we'll add touch events so it works on mobile. We'll also implement the matching logic - when two dogs both like each other, we'll create a match record and send a notification.

**Definition of Done:** Open localhost:3000 on your phone, see a dog profile card, swipe right to like it, then swipe on another dog - the first dog should no longer appear, and you'll get a "Match!" popup when two dogs like each other.

## Phase 3: Chat & Matches
After that we'll add real-time chat using Socket.io so matched dogs can message each other. We'll create a matches page that shows all your dog's matches with their photos, and when you tap one you'll open the chat interface. The messages will be stored in MongoDB with timestamps and read receipts. We'll also add push notifications using a simple service worker so users get notified of new messages even when the app isn't open.

**Definition of Done:** Create two accounts, match them by liking each other, then send a message from one account - you should see it appear instantly on the other account's screen, and get a browser notification if the tab isn't active.

## Phase 4: Polish & Deploy
Finally we'll clean everything up with proper error handling, loading states, and validation. We'll add image optimization using Sharp to automatically resize uploaded photos, implement rate limiting to prevent spam, and set up proper environment configs for production. We'll deploy the backend to Heroku and frontend to Netlify, add a custom domain, and enable SSL. We'll also add basic analytics using a simple event tracking system to monitor usage.

**Definition of Done:** Visit your deployed app at your custom domain, create a profile with a 5MB photo and watch it load quickly, then check the analytics dashboard to see your profile creation event tracked within 5 minutes.
