# Project Description
We’re going to build a browser-based zero-knowledge virtual machine that proves private transactions with nothing more than WebGPU. The goal is pure client-side speed: open a page, tap prove, and the same GPU that renders your game quietly hashes out the proof. We’ll compile hot Rust crypto to SPIR-V through rust-gpu, wrap the rest in TypeScript so it feels like any other web app, and ship a single bundle that works in Chrome, Edge, Brave and soon Firefox. First target is the simplest useful thing: one sender, one receiver, a fixed balance transfer, and a proof that the numbers add up without revealing who or how much. Benchmarks from StarkWare’s Stro show WebGPU can double the whole proving pipeline, so we’ll aim to beat that bar and keep block times under a second on mid-range laptops. No installs, no CUDA lock-in, just a link you can text to a friend and watch their phone churn out a zk-snark before the page finishes loading.
