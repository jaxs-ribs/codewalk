# Project Description

We're building a dead-simple iOS dog-dating app that feels as snappy as flipping through photos on your phone. Picture a stack of big, glossy cards: each card shows one dog's photo, name and a tiny emoji tag. Swipe right with your finger (or let your pup swipe with a wet nose) and the card glides away in under 100 ms; swipe left and it's gone just as fast. When a real bark is detected through the mic the app fires off a super-like, giving that pooch a shiny bone icon and shoving the profile to the top of the other owner's stack. Everything happens in JavaScript inside a lightweight WebKit shell, so we keep the UI at native speed while staying flexible for quick tweaks. To pass App Store review we'll package the bark-trigger and nose-swipe as an "inclusive pet interaction" accessibility mode and ship a fallback one-finger swipe so every human can still use it. The result is a hyper-responsive, tail-waggingly fun matcher that pairs dogs for playdates faster than you can say "who's a good boy?"
