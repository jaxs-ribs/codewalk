# Project Description

We're building a playful iOS dating-style app that lets users swipe through different "God" profiles to discover and engage with various divine figures from world religions. The app presents deity cards with basic info like name, origin, and a brief description, and users swipe right to "match" or left to pass. When there's a match, users get a fun fact about that deity and can save it to their collection. We'll keep the interface clean and simple, focusing on smooth swipe gestures and minimal text. The app will be built in SwiftUI for iOS, using local data so it works offline, and we'll include a diverse range of deities to keep things interesting without being too serious. It's basically Tinder for gods, but lighthearted and educational rather than religious.
