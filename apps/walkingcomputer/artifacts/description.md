# Project Description

We're building a simple dog-matching app that works like Tinder for pups. The core experience is swipe-to-match: you'll see photos of dogs nearby, swipe right if your dog wants to meet them, left to pass. When two owners both swipe right on each other's dogs, it's a match and you'll get notified.

Each dog profile shows their photo, name, breed, age and a short description so you can quickly decide if they seem like a good fit for your pup. We'll keep it super simple - no messaging, no complicated features, just the fun swiping and matching experience.

The app uses your location to find dogs in your area, and you can set preferences for distance and age range. Once you match with another dog, you'll see them in your matches list and can always unmatch later if needed.

It's perfect for finding playmates for your dog or even just seeing cute pups nearby. The interface will be clean and mobile-first, making it easy to swipe through profiles while you're at the park or relaxing at home.
