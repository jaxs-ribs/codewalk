# Project Description

We're building a Tinder style app specifically for dogs to find playmates in their local area. The core concept is simple, owners create profiles for their dogs with photos, basic info like name, age, breed and size, plus their location. Then they swipe through other dogs nearby, right for yes and left for no. When two owners both swipe right on each other's dogs, they get a match and can start chatting to arrange playdates.

The app focuses on real connections rather than endless browsing, so we're limiting users to seeing maybe twenty profiles per day. This keeps it fun and prevents burnout. We're also adding safety features like vaccination status verification and owner ID checks. The chat function lets owners discuss their dogs' personalities, energy levels and preferred activities before meeting up. We'll include a simple scheduling tool so they can easily set up park meetups or walks. The goal is helping dogs socialize and exercise while giving owners an easy way to find compatible play partners for their pets.
