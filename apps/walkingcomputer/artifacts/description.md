# Project Description

Love of Puppies is the dating app that's gone to the dogs—literally. It's Tinder for pups where your furry friend swipes right by licking the screen. We'll build a native iOS app that turns your iPhone into a drool-powered matchmaking machine. Owners create profiles for their dogs with photos and basic info, then let the dogs take over. When a pooch sees a potential playmate, they lick the screen to show interest—no thumbs required. The app detects the tongue contact and registers it as a swipe right, while a nose boop or paw tap means swipe left. We'll use the phone's touch sensors to distinguish between different types of contact, so your dog's unique swipe style works every time. Matches happen when two dogs mutually lick each other's profiles, opening up a chat for the humans to coordinate playdates or walks. The interface stays simple and bright with big photos that grab canine attention, plus subtle animations that keep dogs engaged without overwhelming them. We're basically building the first app designed for dogs to use themselves, with just enough human oversight to keep things safe and fun.
