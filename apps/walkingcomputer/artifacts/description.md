# Project Description

We're building a classic Snake game for iOS that brings back all the nostalgia in a clean, modern package. The game features smooth touch controls where you simply swipe to change direction, making it feel natural on any iPhone. We'll use SpriteKit for silky-smooth animations and reliable collision detection, so when the snake hits the wall or itself, the game ends cleanly.

The snake grows longer each time it eats food, making the game progressively more challenging as you navigate around your own tail. The food spawns randomly across the board, keeping each playthrough fresh and exciting. We've designed a simple scoring system that tracks your current score and displays your best run, so you always know when you're beating your personal record.

The interface stays minimal with a game board that fills most of the screen, leaving just enough room at the top for your score and high score display. When the game ends, you'll see a clear game over screen with options to start fresh. The whole experience loads fast and runs smoothly, whether you're playing for thirty seconds or thirty minutes.
