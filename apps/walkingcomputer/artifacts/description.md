# Project Description

We're building a simple mobile app that lets dog walkers coordinate walks with each other. The core idea is you open the app, see who's nearby and available, then arrange to walk your dogs together. We'll start with the essentials: user profiles for both dogs and walkers, real-time location sharing so folks can find each other, and a basic scheduling system to plan walks. 

The app will show a map view of active walkers in your area with their dogs' info, so you can quickly spot compatible matches. You'll be able to create walk events, invite others, and get notifications when someone wants to join. We'll include a simple rating system after walks to build trust in the community. 

For the first version, we're focusing on making it super easy to find walking buddies in your neighborhood. No complex features - just sign up, add your dog's details, and start connecting with other local dog owners who want company on their walks.
