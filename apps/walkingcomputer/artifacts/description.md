# Project Description

We're building a simple chat app that lets people talk to each other in real time. It's basically a clean, no-fuss messaging platform where you can jump right into conversations without getting bogged down by complicated features.

The app starts with a quick sign-up process so everyone has their own identity. Once you're in, you'll see who's online and can start chatting immediately. Messages appear instantly, so it feels like you're having a natural conversation. You can chat one-on-one with friends or jump into group discussions.

We've kept the interface super minimal - just your contacts list and the chat window. No confusing menus or overwhelming options. It's designed for people who want to connect without dealing with unnecessary bells and whistles. The focus is purely on smooth, reliable messaging that works every time you open the app.

Perfect for anyone who wants straightforward communication without the clutter of social media features or complex settings.
