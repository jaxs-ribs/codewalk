# Project Description

We're building an iOS app that's basically Tinder for dogs. Owners create profiles for their pups with photos and basic info, then swipe through other dogs in their area. The app's got a smart matching score algorithm that weighs owner-input traits and location to rank potential playmates, so the cream rises to the top of the stack. Every profile carries a photo-verification badge that proves the dog in the pics is the dog you'll meetâ€”no catfishing allowed. Once two owners both swipe right, they can message inside the app to set up walks or playdates. It's simple, it's social, and it's all about getting dogs together.
