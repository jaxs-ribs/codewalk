# Phase 3 Complete: Unified Write Handler ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented a unified write handler that consolidates all write operations through a single intelligent `executeWrite()` method, maintaining atomic operations and backward compatibility.

## Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Created executeWrite() Method
- Single entry point for all write operations
- Smart artifact detection (spec/both/description/phasing)
- Instruction parsing for intent recognition
- Routes to appropriate sub-handlers based on context

### 2. ✅ Instruction-Aware Processing
- Detects merge operations from instructions
- Recognizes split operations
- Identifies specific phase edits
- Differentiates between create and edit based on presence of instructions

### 3. ✅ Phase Number/Range Extraction
- Added `extractPhaseNumber()` helper method
- Added `extractPhaseRange()` helper method
- Handles numeric formats (1, 2, 3)
- Handles word formats (one, two, three)
- Recognizes various patterns (phase 3, 3rd phase, phase#5)

### 4. ✅ Routed All Write Actions
- `writeDescription()` → executeWrite("description", nil)
- `writePhasing()` → executeWrite("phasing", nil)
- `writeDescriptionAndPhasing()` → executeWrite("both", nil)
- `editDescription()` → executeWrite("description", instructions)
- `editPhasing()` → executeWrite("phasing", instructions)
- `splitPhase()` → executeWrite("phasing", "split phase N")
- `mergePhases()` → executeWrite("phasing", "merge phases X-Y")

### 5. ✅ Preserved Atomic Operations
- All writes still use `safeWrite()` method
- Backup creation before any modification
- Temp file + atomic move pattern maintained
- No regression in data safety

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- Created UnifiedWriteTests.swift
- 14 test cases covering all operation types
- Tests for create, edit, merge, split
- Edge cases and variations tested
- All tests passing (14/14)

## Key Implementation Details

### executeWrite() Structure
```swift
private func executeWrite(artifact: String, instructions: String?) async {
    // Determine artifact type
    let artifactType = determineArtifactType(artifact)

    // Route based on instructions
    if let inst = instructions {
        // Smart routing for edits/transforms
        if inst.contains("merge") {
            // Extract phases and merge
        } else if inst.contains("split") {
            // Extract phase and split
        } else if inst.contains("phase") {
            // Edit specific phase
        } else {
            // General edit with context
        }
    } else {
        // Create operations
    }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing discrete actions still work
- They now route through unified handler
- Same behavior, cleaner implementation
- No breaking changes to external API

## Test Results
```
=== Summary ===
Total tests: 14
Passed: 14
Failed: 0

✅ All tests passed!
```

## Validation Examples

### Write Operations
- ✅ "write description" → writeDescription via executeWrite
- ✅ "write both" → writeBoth via executeWrite
- ✅ "create the spec" → writeBoth via executeWrite

### Edit Operations
- ✅ "make it shorter" → edit with instructions
- ✅ "add more detail" → edit with context
- ✅ "edit phase 3: add tests" → specific phase edit

### Transform Operations
- ✅ "merge phases 2 and 3" → mergePhases(2, 3)
- ✅ "split phase 5 into parts" → splitPhase(5)
- ✅ "combine phases 1-3" → mergePhases(1, 3)

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. `Sources/Orchestrator.swift` - Added executeWrite(), updated all write methods
2. `Tests/UnifiedWriteTests.swift` - New comprehensive test suite

### Code Consolidation
- Reduced duplication in write operations
- Centralized instruction processing
- Unified pattern for all write-family actions
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Next Steps

Phase 4 will create a unified read handler using the same pattern, consolidating all read operations through a single intelligent method that understands scope and context.

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Single unified write handler implemented
- ✅ All write operations routing through it
- ✅ Instruction parsing working correctly
- ✅ Atomic operations preserved
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No regression in functionality
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
