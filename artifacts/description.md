# Number-Sequence Announcement Module

Replace any audible phasing cue with a crisp, numeric countdown from 1 to 10. The module intercepts the legacy phasing signal, substitutes the sequence “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10”, and outputs it through the same audio path—no other content or timing is altered.

## Key Capabilities
- Drop-in replacement: no changes to upstream or downstream components
- Zero-latency injection: sequence aligns exactly with the original phasing window
- Language-agnostic: uses only numeric samples, eliminating localization needs
- Repeatable trigger: activates on every detected phasing event
- Lightweight footprint: runs inline without extra memory or CPU budget

## Technical Approach
Hook the existing audio callback, pattern-match the phasing envelope, and overwrite the buffer with pre-rendered PCM digits. A state machine gates the replacement to prevent retriggering within 50 ms, while a circular buffer holds the 10-element sample set. The process is sample-accurate and leaves metadata untouched, ensuring downstream systems remain unaware of the swap.
