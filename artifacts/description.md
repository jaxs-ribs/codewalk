# Walk and Code

You are walking. Your phone is in your pocket. You speak a single sentence, "write the description," and the app quietly saves a full project brief. You say, "write the phasing," and it stores the step-by-step plan. Nothing else runs in the background. When you want to hear what you made, you say, "read," and the phone reads it back through your earbuds. That is the whole product.

This matters because ideas strike while you move. Typing on glass while walking is dangerous and awkward. Speaking is instant, hands-free, and keeps your eyes on the path. Capture the idea, break it into tasks, and walk on.

Inside the app, one tiny voice loop listens for three exact commands. It records your speech, turns it into clean text, and saves two living documents: a spoken description and a spoken phasing plan. Each command blocks until the file is safely written, so you always know the state. No threads, no surprises, no battery burn.

Using it feels like talking to a calm assistant who only answers when asked. You hear a soft chime when writing starts and the word "done" when the file is saved. Later, when you say "read," the same calm voice reads your words back at walking speed. You finish the walk with a clear head and a project ready for the desk.
